## Let's go through the results of last year's SIP experiment. 
## Next year they will do the same with your data!

## activate a conda environment with the software we need:
conda activate qualityControlRawSequences

## let's make a working directory, and find our raw data

## I'll put my working directory for this here:

mkdir /vol/funmic/metabarcoding

cd /vol/funmic/metabarcoding

## our raw sequence data is stored here:

ls /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/raw_reads

## the file names contain the substrate, isotope, and fraction information for each sample 

## let's take a look at the quality of these reads...

## for convenience, we made a single file out of all of the samples for you, so you can look at them all at once,

## here:

ls /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/allRawReads.fastq.gz


## remember what a fastq file is?
zless /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/allRawReads.fastq.gz

## we can run a quality check using the program fastqc
fastqc -o .  -t 12 /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/allRawReads.fastq.gz

## get the output files onto your computer, especially the html file

############## I have to do this, but you probably don't, just use MobaXterm!! ###############

## look at this quality report with a browser - what do you see?

## here is the blast website if you want to look at one of your 
## sequences: 
https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

#### raw read quality control #####

## we have a set of forward 16s primers (515F) that look like this:
  GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA
 CGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA
TCGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA

## our 16S 806 reverse primer is:
GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT

## (https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html)

## we can feed this info to our primer-cutting software

## make a folder to put your trimmed reads:

mkdir /vol/funmic/metabarcoding/trimmed_reads/

## for one file, we would run it like this:


## go to the directory with the raw read files
cd /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/raw_reads

inputFastq=A12-05.fastq.gz ## example file
outputDir=/vol/funmic/metabarcoding/trimmed_reads/
cutadapt --rc \
    -g TCGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA \
    --length 280 \
    -a GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT \
    -o ${outputDir}${inputFastq} \
       ${inputFastq}

## what just happened??
## we just made a new file... where did it go? can you find it?

cd $outputDir

## but we have lots of files (23). We need a loop. Remember how to do this?:

for i in *; do
  echo here is a file: $i
done

## so a loop to trim out primers from all of our files would look like this:

## make a directory to put our trimmed files, if you didn't already above
mkdir /vol/funmic/metabarcoding/trimmed_reads/

## make sure you are still in the directory with the raw read files
cd /vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/raw_reads

## and redo, this time looping through ALL of our raw reads files
outputDir=/vol/funmic/metabarcoding/trimmed_reads/
for inputFastq in *; do
    cutadapt --rc \
        -g TCGTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA \
        --length 280 \
        -a GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT \
        -o ${outputDir}${inputFastq} \
           ${inputFastq}
done

## primers should be gone! onward...

## first we need an introduction to R ##
############# Introduction to R #####################

cd

R

## let's play with R a little bit

## where are we?

getwd()

## where do we want to be?

setwd("/vol/funmic")

getwd()


### if we don't know what a function does, we can ask for help:

?getwd

### let's make a dataframe


df <- mtcars

df = mtcars

df

head(df)

tail(df)

## we can take pieces of these data using numerical indices:
df[1:3,1:4] 

## by the way, what are all these data?

?mtcars

## how to get a vecter of data out of a dataframe:

df$mpg


df$hp

## just as with the linux terminal we can check to see 
## what variables we have defined in our environment

ls()


## R has a basic plotter - does it work for you?


plot(df$mpg, df$hp)


## don't be afraid to quit:

q()

quit()




## R base is extended by loading packages
## let's try a different plotting software, ggplot:




library(ggplot2)




## some times we have to change the class of a vector of data.
## for example, change the number of cylinders ("cyl") from
## numerical data to categorical data:

df$cyl <- as.factor(df$cyl)


ggplot(df, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl, shape=cyl)) +
    geom_point(size=3)




## if you want to start a different plotter:

dev.new()

ggplot(df, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=am, shape=cyl)) +
    geom_point(size=3)

## if you want to save this graphic, save it as a 
## variable and...

prettyGraphic <- ggplot(df, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, color=cyl, shape=cyl)) +
                 geom_point(size=3)

ggsave("prettyGraphic.pdf",
        device = pdf,
        plot = prettyGraphic,
        width = 10,
        height = 6)

## now lets get back to our pipeline...

###### denoising and ASV definition #######

## we here we need R. 
## back to our working directory

cd /vol/funmic/metabarcoding/trimmed_reads


## start R!

R

library(dada2)
library(phyloseq)

## where are our trimmed reads?

fileNames <- list.files()

## did that work?:

fileNames

## do some quality filtering on these reads before denoising

## where should we put these? 
filterPath <- "/vol/funmic/metabarcoding/filtered"

out <- filterAndTrim(fileNames, filterPath,
              maxN=0, maxEE=2, truncQ=2, rm.phix=TRUE,
              compress=TRUE, multithread=TRUE)

## did we lose a lot of reads?:

out 

## move over to the filtered reads:
setwd("/vol/funmic/metabarcoding/filtered")

## use characterize the errors in the base calling of the sequencer

err <- learnErrors(fileNames, multithread=TRUE) 

save(err, file="err.rda")


load("err.rda")


plotErrors(err, nominalQ=TRUE)


## this step defines our ASVs:
dadaF <- dada(fileNames, err=err, pool=TRUE, multithread=TRUE)

## now that we have ASVs, we can make an OTU table:
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(dadaF) 


seqtab.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, method="consensus", multithread=TRUE, verbose=TRUE)



## make the sample names prettier

## look at them:
rownames(seqtab.nochim)

rownames(seqtab.nochim) <- unlist(strsplit(rownames(seqtab.nochim), ".fastq.gz"))

## how do they look now?
rownames(seqtab.nochim)


## now we have OTUs (ASVs) and an otu table
## let's get taxonomic assignments:

path2silvaDB <- "/vol/funmic/databases/metabarcodingSilvaDB/silva_nr99_v138.2_toGenus_trainset.fa.gz"

taxa <- assignTaxonomy(seqtab.nochim, path2silvaDB, multithread=TRUE)


## sample information is contained in the file names,
## but we need it in a dataframe:

samdf <- read.csv("/vol/funmic/datasets/Barcode2026/sip2026.csv", 
                   row.names=1,)

## we have to tell R that the isotope variable is categorical:

samdf$Isotope <- as.factor( samdf$Isotope )


## how does it look?

samdf

## now we have ASVs with their DNA sequences, and OTU table showing their abundances, 
## taxonomic assignments for these ASVs, and sample information
## These are the basic components of a microbial community ecology dataset. 
## let's bring these together into a single object using the Phyloseq package


ps <- phyloseq(otu_table(seqtab.nochim, taxa_are_rows=FALSE),
               sample_data(samdf),
               tax_table(taxa))

## insert our representative sequences for our OTUs:
dna <- Biostrings::DNAStringSet(taxa_names(ps))
names(dna) <- taxa_names(ps)
ps <- merge_phyloseq(ps, dna)
## give our ASVs pretty names instead of DNA sequences:
taxa_names(ps) <- paste0("ASV", seq(ntaxa(ps)))

## now you can explore your data with phyloseq!
## for a good intro to phyloseq, see: https://vaulot.github.io/tutorials/Phyloseq_tutorial.html#gettin-started

## save this object for later!:

## move back to our working directory:
setwd("/vol/funmic/metabarcoding/")

save(ps, file="sipPS.rda")

## you can then bring this phyloseq object back into your 
## R environment whenever you want by typing:

load("sipPS.rda")
