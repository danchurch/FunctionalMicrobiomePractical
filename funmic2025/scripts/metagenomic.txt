#### Metagenome analysis #######
## First, create a folder  for all the new files that you will generate during the analysis.
## We will keep it organized and structured to easily find the output produced by the different tools

# Make a new directory "Kelp" under /vol/funmic/
mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp

## I. Checking the Illumina sequence reads: quality of the data? Microbial composituion of the raw data: What did get sequenced?

conda activate qualityControlRawSequences

mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp/logs

## The Illumina reads from the white kelp biofims from Helgoland is here:
READ_DIRECTORY=/vol/funmic/datasets/kelpBiofilm

#paper: Van Erk et al. 2021, doi.org/mgt4
#dataset accession number on NCBI/ENA: PRJEB36085

#Checking read quality with FastQC for all reads. FastQC can also be run with an interactive GUI by typing 'fastqc' into the command line
mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp/rawReadQC
OUTPUTDIRECTORY=/vol/funmic/Kelp/rawReadQC
