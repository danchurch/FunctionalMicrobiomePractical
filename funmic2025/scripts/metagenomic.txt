#### Metagenome analysis #######

# In this course we are analyzing DNA shotgun sequencing data from the following publication:
# paper: Van Erk et al. 2021, doi.org/mgt4
# dataset accession number on NCBI/ENA: PRJEB36085

## First, create a folder  for all the new files that you will generate during the analysis.
## We will keep it organized and structured to easily find the output produced by the different tools

# Make a new directory "Kelp" under /vol/funmic/
mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp

# Make a sub directory to store log files of some programs
mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp/logs

## The Illumina reads from the white kelp biofims from Helgoland is here: /vol/funmic/datasets/kelpBiofilm
## We store this location under the variable READ_DIRECTORY
READ_DIRECTORY=/vol/funmic/datasets/kelpBiofilm

#Checking read quality with FastQC for all reads. FastQC can also be run with an interactive GUI by typing 'fastqc' into the command line
mkdir /vol/funmic/Kelp/rawReadQC
OUTPUTDIRECTORY=/vol/funmic/Kelp/rawReadQC
