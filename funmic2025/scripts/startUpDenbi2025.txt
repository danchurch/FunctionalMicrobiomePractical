## okay, starting the setup for the funmic practical, spring 2025

## our setup instance is here:

ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh/private/key ubuntu@129.70.51.6 -p 30423

## oops. Wrong key. do we have the denbi key on this work computer?
## this is probably a key on my laptop....

## for conda, I think Dimitri and I need to share a user on this computer. 
## will just need to add his key.
