## to log in with a terminal:

ssh -X -i  ubuntu@129.70.51.6 -p 30423
ssh ubuntu@129.70.51.6 -p 30423

## you can try this (especially if you are a mac user!), or you can use MobaXterm

## playing around with BASH (the linux command line)

## use wget to get the latest version of the intro script (this document!)

## first, you need to get this document, somehow...point and click from the link on the 
## skript pdf (section C1, page 21) 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical/main/funmic2024/scripts/funBASHterminalScript.txt

## you can use the command "wget" to download it while you are in the terminal:

## and now, let's practice some commands and getting around in a linux filetree.

pwd 

ls 

cd  /

## look at the storage volume:

cd /vol/funMicStorage

## btw there should be a shortcut stored on your computer:
vol ## typing this should get you to the volume.

cp 

cp bin1.fa zoop.fa

mv zoop.fa ../  

mv zoop.fa /vol/funMicStorage


mkdir newDirectory

mkdir /vol/funMicStorage/zoop

rmdir 

echo 

cat 

rm 

sudo 

top 

man top
top --help
top -h


head 

tail 

less 

## special characters




## ~  ##

cd ~

## .  ##


## .. ## 





cd ..







## > ##

echo "this a file" > file.txt



## |  ##

one program | second program

## ;  ##

ls; cd ~

ls
cd ~


## /  ##

## \  ##

mkdir "this is a folder"

## &  ##




top &





## = and $ ##

X="this is a variable"
echo $X



vol 

cd someFiles




## *  ##

ls bin*

## ? ##

ls bin??fa




## this is a note 






## # ## 

## loops ##

for ZOOP in *
do
  echo $ZOOP
done

echo $FILENAME

FILENAME="zzoop"

echo $FILENAME

## 

## we can use files as lists:

cd someFiles 

for i in $(cat bin5.fa)
do
  echo "this is data?" $i
done

## or look at some numbers...

for i in {0..10}; do
  echo "this is a number?" $i
done

### and a note about filepaths in linux

## relative file paths
cd 

cd /vol

cd funMicStorage

cd ..

pwd

## absolute file paths

cd /vol/funMicStorage

## what's the difference between these?
## (relative and absolute file paths)

## and now let's learn how to get files onto and off our VM. 

## find one of the fasta files in the directory called
## /vol/funMicStorage/someFiles with MobaXterm and put 
## it on your local computer. 

## Make sure you can find it on both computers.


############### For mac users ####################

## you will get your files the old-fashioned way!

getFile=
