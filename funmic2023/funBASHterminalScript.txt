## playing around with BASH (the linux command line)

## use wget to get the latest version of the intro script (this document!)

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical2022/main/funmic2023/funBASHterminalScript.txt

## an example remote login: Dan and his de.NBI machine (danBot):

ssh -p 30500 -i /home/daniel/.ssh/funmic2023 ubuntu@129.70.51.6

## or, using shell variables

key=/home/daniel/.ssh/funmic2023
ssh -p 30500 -i $key ubuntu@129.70.51.6

## look at the storage volume:

cd /vol/danBot

## and let's learn how to get files onto and off our VM. 


fileOnVM="/vol/danBot/helloWorld.txt"
mySSHkey="/home/daniel/.ssh/funmic2023"

scp -i $mySSHkey -P 30500 ubuntu@129.70.51.6:$fileOnVM .


scp -P 30284 -i /home/daniel/.ssh/ubuntu_e ubuntu@129.70.51.6:$fileOnVM .

## here windows and linux can share files if we put a folder here:

cd /mnt/c/

sudo mkdir putFilesHere

## put the file we just downloaded there:
mv helloWorld.txt /mnt/c/putFilesHere

## can you see it windows? look in the your C:\ drive.


## let's get our nanopore assembly going, because this takes a very long time.

## on my computer, I do the following:


## get into the right conda environment
conda activate flye

## make a directory for our new assembly:
mkdir -p /vol/danBot/assemblies/zymoMC/nanopore/

## or you could make a folder here:
cd /vol/danBot/
mkdir zymoNanoporeAssembly

## set my variables
reads=/vol/danBot/datasets/zymoMC/nanopore/ERR7287988_shortened.fastq
outdir=/vol/danBot/assemblies/zymoMC/nanopore/
## (or your output directory might look like this, depends on what you did above):
## outdir=/vol/danBot/zymoNanoporeAssembly


## run it, using nohup to make sure it doesn't die when we hang up the connection
nohup flye --meta \
    --threads 25 \
    --out-dir $outdir \
    --nano-hq $reads &

## this is the same as:
nohup flye --meta --threads 25 --out-dir $outdir --nano-hq $reads &
