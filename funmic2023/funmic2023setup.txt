## okay, time to start setting up the 2023 funmic class
## first steps, today:

## 0 - clean out the old folders, github repo
## done
## 1 - setup the instance for development
## instance initiated, I think? Not showing on my dashboard...

## 2 - get data sets

## maybe let's check out the Sereika/Albertson data and pipeline:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01539-7#data-availability

## their repo is here:
https://github.com/Serka-M/Digester-MultiSequencing

## their pipeline is really similar to the one we used last year,
## though no biobakery tools were used, just gtdb-tk. 

## I like the biobakery tools, let's decide when we get there...

## they have both mock and environmental data

## the mock DNA is from the zymogen mock community. 
## the eDNA is from activated sludge from an anaerobic sewage
## treatment plant. I don't really understand, because I
## thought "activated" implied the injection of oxygen
## into sewage material...
## intentionally anaerobic conditions implies they wanted
## methane production.
## not sure. Anyway...

## They have illumina reads, pacbio, and nanopore sequence data
## The nanopore data is of two flowcell generations, R10.4 and R9.4.1

## data for the mock community are here:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB48692

## in both cases, there are two nanopore platforms on there...
## do we want their minion data?

## quote: 
## "Anaerobic digester and Zymo R.9.4.1 datasets were generated on a MinION Mk1B (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) device"

## so we want the minion datasets

## in the case of the zymo data, I think the nanopore would be:
## sample name = SAMEA10644976 , library name = LIB-Zymo_HMW_R941 
## found here:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR7255742

## note there are promethion data for the R10.4 in the next entry, 
## we won't use the promethion R10.4 data

## I think we are going to need a way to do this without a gui...

## for instance, does this work for the Nanopore Zymo data?

wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR725/002/ERR7255742/ERR7255742.fastq.gz
## looks like it works...so theoretically these are the files we
## need:

## zymo files (illumina miseq F+R, Nanopore minion):
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR725/009/ERR7255689/ERR7255689_1.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR725/009/ERR7255689/ERR7255689_2.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR725/002/ERR7255742/ERR7255742.fastq.gz


## biodigestor files (illumina miseq F+R, Nanopore minion):
## here they have two minion runs. One seems to be for a R10.3 cell.
## So again, stick with the R9.4.1 cell..
## also, there are two sets of illumina miseq files, one set from 2018,
## and one from 2020. The 2020 set doesn't have a finished "generated" fastq
## from the ENA folks. Supp. table 4 seems important here...

wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR701/006/ERR7014876/ERR7014876.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR701/ERR7015307/IL-202001-1.fastq.gz
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR701/ERR7015307/IL-202001-2.fastq.gz

## can't find any further data. These last two are the submitted 2020 miseq 
## files, maybe they will work, if not try the 2018 files

## data for the digester are here:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB48021

## let's use the R9.4.1 data for the nanopore data
## this is the one that benefitted from polishing 
## with illumina data

## We'll try assembly with illumina alone, nanopore alone, and then 
## nanopore polished by illumina

## weird, though, they used 9 years of illumina data to 
## assist binning...hmm... wonder if we can skip that in the class.

## run through these for the zymogen together, then set them loose on
## the bioreactor data

## they don't have fast5 files, I don't think...
## should we practise basecalling with another dataset?

## tomorrow, start running through the datasets.
## this paper is a bit misleading. The title should actually say something
## like "Near perfect nanopore MAGs without illumina polishing, but with nine years
## of illumina data to help binning"....

## oh well. Let's see how we do. If we have to, go back to mbarc and chu.
