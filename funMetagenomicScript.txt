#### here we will keep our script of our metagenomic project ####

## let's look at our mock community reads with fastqc  

## first we have to log in again to your de.NBI machine with ssh

## your login info is in the funBASHterminalScript.txt

## that script is at https://github.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical2022

## you can download it by going to 

## https://github.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical2022/blob/main/funBASHterminalScript.txt

## and right-clicking on "Raw" and saving it.

## this is my key, that I use for logins
pathToKey=/home/daniel/.ssh/denbiTestVM
ssh -p 30009 -i $pathToKey ubuntu@129.70.51.6
## your port will be different, I think this is Kai's de.NBI machine

## now that you are on your machine...

#### quality control of reads #### 

## activate conda
conda env list 

conda activate readQC_env

## your reads for the mock community should be here:
cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/sequenceData/mbarc

## look at the file - how big is it?
ls -lh smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## what does a fastq file look like in real life?:
head smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## let's run fastqc to get a quality report
## -o tells fastqc where to put its output 
## --threads 8 tells fastqc to use 8 processors  

fastqc -o /home/ubuntu/danFastQCout --threads 8 smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## let's get the file from de.NBI to our local computers, with scp

pathToKey=/home/daniel/.ssh/denbiTestVM

scp -P 30009 -i $pathToKey \
ubuntu@129.70.51.6:/home/ubuntu/danFastQCout/smallerMBARC_trimmed_fastqc.html .
 
## put this somewhere where both windows and linux can read it:

cp smallerMBARC_trimmed_fastqc.html /mnt/c/PUTLINUXFILESHERE/

######### start assembly ############

## let's start the job of making an assembly with megahit

conda env list

conda activate assembly_env

MBARCreads=/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/sequenceData/mbarc/smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

megahit -r $MBARCreads -o ~/megahitMBARCOut -t 8

## this will run for a while!
