#### here we will keep our script of our metagenomic project ####

## let's look at our mock community reads with fastqc  

## first we have to log in again to your de.NBI machine with ssh

## your login info is in the funBASHterminalScript.txt

## that script is at https://github.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical2022

## you can download it by going to 

## https://github.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical2022/blob/main/funBASHterminalScript.txt

## and right-clicking on "Raw" and saving it.

## this is my key, that I use for logins
pathToKey=/home/daniel/.ssh/denbiTestVM
ssh -p 30009 -i $pathToKey ubuntu@129.70.51.6
## your port will be different, I think this is Kai's de.NBI machine

## now that you are on your machine...

#### quality control of reads #### 

## activate conda
conda env list 

conda activate readQC_env

## your reads for the mock community should be here:
cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/sequenceData/mbarc

## look at the file - how big is it?
ls -lh smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## what does a fastq file look like in real life?:
head smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## let's run fastqc to get a quality report
## -o tells fastqc where to put its output 
## --threads 8 tells fastqc to use 8 processors  

fastqc -o /home/ubuntu/danFastQCout --threads 8 smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

## let's get the file from de.NBI to our local computers, with scp

pathToKey=/home/daniel/.ssh/denbiTestVM

scp -P 30009 -i $pathToKey \
ubuntu@129.70.51.6:/home/ubuntu/danFastQCout/smallerMBARC_trimmed_fastqc.html .
 
## put this somewhere where both windows and linux can read it:

cp smallerMBARC_trimmed_fastqc.html /mnt/c/PUTLINUXFILESHERE/

######### start assembly ############

## let's start the job of making an assembly with megahit

conda env list

conda activate assembly_env

MBARCreads=/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/sequenceData/mbarc/smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

megahit -r $MBARCreads -o ~/megahitMBARCOut -t 8

## this will run for a while!


######### check assembly with metaquast #############

## let's run a quick check on our assembly with metaquast

## get on your denbi machine, your port and key will be different
pathToKey=~/.ssh/denbiTestVM
ssh -p 30112 -i $pathToKey ubuntu@129.70.51.6

## remember that for us, most of the interesting files are here:
cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol

## activate the correct conda environment 
conda activate quast_env

## where is our assembly from megahit?

## it will be where you asked megahit to build its output directory above

## if you can't find it, this might work:

## the find command!!!

find . -name "final.contigs.fa"

## once you find it, look around in that directory. What do you see?

## make a working directory for metaquast

mkdir -p /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaquast/mbarc

cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaquast/mbarc

## now run metaquast on your reads

pathToAssembly="/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/final.contigs.fa" ## yours will be different!
metaquast --threads 6 $pathToAssembly 

## metaquast ships with some visualizations... 

## remember the process of getting files into windows from de.NBI?

## leave de.NBI 
logout

## my quast outputs are here, set a variable to there
quastOutputs=/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaquast/mbarc/quast_results
## use scp to get the file, as usual your port and key will be different
pathToKey=~/.ssh/denbiTestVM

## get the directory! note that we have to use "-r" option, because it is a folder
scp -r -P 30112 -i $pathToKey ubuntu@129.70.51.6:$quastOutputs .

## this has numerous icarus and krona charts, with comparisons to established 
## genomes that blasted close the 16s sequences that were extracted from our 
## assembly. Let's look through them!


#### metaphlan ####

conda env list

conda activate metaphlan_env

metaphlanMarkerDB=/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaphlanMarkerDB
MBARCraw=/vol/studentFunMic1Vol/sequenceData/mbarc/smallerMBARC_trimmed.fq

mkdir -p /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaphlanWD/mbarcMPA
cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaphlanWD/mbarcMPA

metaphlan $MBARCraw \
    --bowtie2db $metaphlanMarkerDB \
    --nproc 6 \
    --input_type fastq \
    -o mbarcMetaPhlanProfiled_metagenome.txt \

## this should have produced a single text file, mine is here:

cd /vol/studentFunMic1Vol/metaphlanWD/mbarcMPA

## let's look at it:

less mbarcMetaPhlanProfiled_metagenome.txt

## that's a lot. Let's look at the lowest level, let's do some BASH magic on it:

grep -E "s__|clade" mbarcMetaPhlanProfiled_metagenome.txt | sed 's/^.*s__//g' | cut -f1,3 > mbarcMetaPhlanAbundances.tsv

## you can look at that with your de.NBI machine using less, or you can 
## get it locally with the usual methods, maybe to make some nice graphs. 

## how do these abundances compare to metaquast, and to the paper itself 

## are there any differences? Why would they be different?
