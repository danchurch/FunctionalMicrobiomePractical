## to log in with a terminal:

ssh -Y -p 30476 -i /home/daniel/.ssh/./id_ed25519 ubuntu@129.70.51.6

## you can try this, or you can use MobaXterm

## playing around with BASH (the linux command line)

## use wget to get the latest version of the intro script (this document!)

## first, you need to get this document, somehow...point and click from the link on the 
## skript pdf (section C1, page 21) 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danchurch/FunctionalMicrobiomePractical/main/funmic2024/scripts/funBASHterminalScript.txt

## you can use the command "wget" to download it while you are in the terminal:

## and now, let's practice some commands and getting around in a linux filetree.

pwd 

ls 

cd 

## look at the storage volume:

cd /vol/funMicStorage

## btw there should be a shortcut stored on your computer:
vol ## typing this should get you to the volume.

cp 

mv 

mkdir 

rmdir 

echo 

cat 

rm 

sudo 

top 

man 

head 

tail 

less 

## special characters
## ~  ##
## .  ##
## .. ## 
## >  ##
## |  ##
## ;  ##
## /  ##
## \  ##
## &  ##
## = and $ ##

dirX=
echo $dirX

## *  ##
## ?  ##
## #  ## 

## loops ##

for i in *
do
  echo $i
done

## we can use files as lists:

## make a file if this isn't already there

for i in $(cat bin5.fa)
do
  echo "this is data?" $i
done

## and let's learn how to get files onto and off our VM. 


## find one of the fasta files with MobaXterm and put it on your local
## computer. Make sure you can find it on both computers.
