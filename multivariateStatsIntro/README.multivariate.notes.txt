Resources for learning about multivariate statistics for microbial ecologists:

1. See this paper:

Ramette, Alban. "Multivariate analyses in microbial ecology." FEMS microbiology ecology 62.2 (2007): 142-160. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2007.00375.x

 - I put a copy of this in the class github repository
 - this is the same author behind the GUSTA ME website
 
2. Speaking of, the GUSTA ME website:
https://mb3is.megx.net/gustame
 - this is really good for understanding the common ordination methods and statistical models we use.
 
3. Legendre & Legendre's book This is the "bible" for Numerical Ecology (= multivariate statistics for ecologists):

Legendre, P.; Legendre, L. Numerical Ecology; Developments in Environmental Modelling; Third.; Elsevier, 2012; Vol. 24; ISBN 978-0-444-53868-0.

- it is not a light read, but is an excellent reference. 
- it has a companion book that is much easier to use for learning, with examples and tutorials in R:

4. Numerical ecology in R:

Borcard, Daniel, Fran√ßois Gillet, and Pierre Legendre. Numerical ecology with R. Second ed. New York: Springer, 2018.

- this is the companion to Numerical Ecology, much easier to learn from. 
- Also teaches you the R programming language. 
- available in digital form from the Uni-Bayreuth library to all of you! For a limited time I have put a copy of the pdf in the github repo.
